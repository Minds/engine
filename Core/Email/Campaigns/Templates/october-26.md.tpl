We have some EPIC news!

Minds has just raised $6M from Patrick Byrne and Medici Ventures, a team dedicated to Internet freedom, advancing blockchain technology and decentralizing the web. This is a momentous step which will allow us to put massive resources into evolving the platform, building the team and expanding the Minds global network. 
 
Your personal energy is responsible for this milestone, both as investors and as members of the community. Please take a moment to read our blog about this announcement and what it means for all of us.
