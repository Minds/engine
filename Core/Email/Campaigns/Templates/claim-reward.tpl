            <p>
                Thank you for being a part of history by investing $<?php echo number_format($vars['amount']) ?> in the Minds Regulation Crowdfunding <a href="https://wefunder.com/minds" taget="_blank">campaign</a>. We reached $1 million dollars in only 19 days making us the fastest Reg C round ever!
            </p>
            <p>
                The response from our community was so overwhelmingly positive that it has taken us longer than anticipated to finalize the process with Wefunder and receive everyoneâ€™s funds, so we appreciate your patience.
            </p>
