Before the MINDS token goes live on Monday at 12 PM UTC, there are a few things you should do to prepare.

1) Visit the [MINDS Token page](https://minds.com/token?__e_ct_guid=<?= $vars['guid']?>&campaign=<?= $vars['campaign']?>&topic=<?= $vars['topic'] ?>) and read our "Token Specs" for important information about the token.

2) [Opt-in to the rewards program](https://minds.com/wallet/tokens/contributions?__e_ct_guid=<?= $vars['guid']?>&campaign=<?= $vars['campaign']?>&topic=<?= $vars['topic'] ?>) so you can claim your Beta reward tokens when we go live. **You must complete this step to keep your token balance when we move over to the Ethereum Mainnet.**

3) [Set up your OnChain wallet](https://www.minds.com/minds/blog/how-to-setup-your-wallet-with-metamask-871783126122799104?__e_ct_guid=<?= $vars['guid']?>&campaign=<?= $vars['campaign']?>&topic=<?= $vars['topic'] ?>) so your channel can transact on the blockchain and receive 25% bonus rewards.

4) [Purchase some Ether](https://www.minds.com/minds/blog/how-to-buy-eth-on-coinbase-871789298595016704?__e_ct_guid=<?= $vars['guid']?>&campaign=<?= $vars['campaign']?>&topic=<?= $vars['topic'] ?>) so you can buy MINDS tokens when we launch. This process can take several days so it is important to start now if you wish to participate.

If you have any questions, please feel free to post in the [support group](https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/100000000000000681) or email us at info@minds.com.

Thank you for being a part of this great movement!
