It recently came to our attention that a software change we made has impacted the status of your Minds+ membership.

This email is to inform you that we have issued you a **full token refund** for the time in which your membership was impacted, and **any future payments have been canceled**. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Because we value your support, we have also decided to grant you **one free year of Minds+**. No action is required on your part to activate this.
