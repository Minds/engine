            Minds is now available in dozens of global languages on both web and mobile apps.
            This includes translations of display language, posts, notifications, hashtags, emails and more.
            We recently experienced a surge of over 250,000 new users from Thailand over privacy concerns on Twitter and were inspired to finally get this done.

            Most of the translations are not yet verified.
