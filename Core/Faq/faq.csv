,Token,What is the Minds token?,The Minds token is an Ethereum ERC-20 utility token that can be exchanged for services on the Minds network.
,Token,Where can I read the whitepaper?,"Our whitepaper can be accessed at https://minds.com by clicking on your channel in the upper right corner, or visiting https://minds.com/token. "
,Token,What is the Minds token contract address?,All token purchases must be made through the purchase flow on https://minds.com/token. Minds will not accept direct transfers outside of this flow. All smart contract addresses can be found at https://github.com/Minds/crypto-internal/wiki/Addresses. 
,Token,Can I use an Ethereum address from an exchange?,"No. It is very important that you do not use an address from an exchange like Coinbase or any other cryptocurrency exchange. The reason is that once you send your ether to the Minds Token Sale address, the tokens are assigned to that address’ private key; since services like Coinbase don’t provide you with the key, you won’t be able to move the tokens when it comes time to actually access them. By using such services to participate in a token sale you will be effectively forfeiting your tokens to Coinbase (and they have plenty of money so don’t bother)."" "
,Token,Are Minds tokens transferable? Where are they traded?,"Minds tokens are utility tokens intended to be used on the Minds platform. They are transferable among channels on Minds using Wire. They are not currently being traded on any public exchanges, and Minds cannot guarantee that they will ever be listed on any public exchanges."
,Token,Where will Minds tokens be used?,"We have built the Minds token to integrate fully with our web app and Android mobile app. The utility tokens can be exchanged for services on the Minds network, including Boost, Wire and Plus. The tokens can be used, for example, to receive promoted views on a piece of content, or to pay for exclusive content from another channel."
,Token,Why not use an existing cryptocurrency instead?,"The Minds token is a utility token, not a digital currency. It can be used as a means of exchange for services within the Minds network and as a unit of measurement for rewarding user contribution. The token leverages smart contracts that are specifically designed for Minds services such as Boost and Wire. Leveraging a custom Minds token helps mitigate some of the scalability issues associated with Ethereum."

The formula used to measure your contribution score can be found at https://minds.com/wallet/tokens/contributions."
