,Wire,What is a reward tier?,"Reward tiers are ways for content creators to build their own membership business on Minds. Creators can set different levels of reward tiers that provide different value for their supporters, similar to Patreon or other crowdfunding sites."
,Wire,How do I create a reward tier?,"You can set all of your reward tiers directly on your channel or Wallet by editing the widget called “Rewards”. In this widget, you can set the payment required and description for each level of rewards. Users must then Wire you the amount specified in order to access the rewards associated with each subscription."

,TestNet,How do I get test Ethereum for the TestNet?,We will automatically deposit test Ethereum tokens into your wallet when you configure your OnChain address. You can also claim more ETH from www.rinkeby.io.
,TestNet,What can I do with a TestNet token?,"Tokens held during the TestNet phase will have the same utility on Minds as a normal token. They are accepted for boost, Wire, Plus and more. You can exchange them for views on content with Boost, or you can send them to other channels as a tip or for custom rewards with Wire. These tokens are not transferable and are running on the Rinkeby Ethereum Test network. More information regarding the transition to the Main Ethereum network will be released in the future."
,TestNet,What happened to my Points balance?,"Your Points balance has been converted into OffChain tokens for the TestNet phase. OffChain tokens hold the same exact value as Points. You can use them to Boost your content for more views, or send to other channels you support with Wire. We have exchanged your Points for OffChain tokens at a rate of 1,000 Points per 1 token."
,TestNet,Why can't I receive any more payments in USD?,"With the addition of crypto, Minds has migrated away from the Stripe platform. This is an important step to become more independent and less reliant on proprietary third parties. Any user who was receiving a recurring monthly payment in USD through Stripe will continue to receive these payments. Any new payment will be in Minds tokens. "
,TestNet,How long will the TestNet go on for?,"The TestNet will remain in production for all users until further notice. This is an important step because it allows us time to audit our smart contracts and code, improve the rewards scoring and distribution systems, and just as we have done during Minds beta, gain critical feedback from the community on areas where we may improve."
,TestNet,When will the token ecomomics be released?,We do not have a date for this yet. We are using the TestNet phase to make necessary changes and gain more insight on our token economics.
,TestNet,How many tokens are in the daily reward pool during the TestNet?,"We will be testing out different reward distributions throughout the TestNet phase. For this reason, there is no set answer as the total amount of tokens in the token reward pool may vary each day."
,TestNet,What happens to my existing subcription to Points or Minds Plus?,Anyone who had an existing recurring monthly subscription for either Points or a Minds Plus account will receive the same value as they were previously. The only difference will be that these users will receive OffChain tokens in place of the Points.
,TestNet,What happens if I have been supporting another channel with a monthly recurring USD payment?,"If you are using Wire to support another channel on a monthly basis with USD, your payments will continue as normal. If you wish to cancel this subscription, you can do so in the billing section of your settings. "
